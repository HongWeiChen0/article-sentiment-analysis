# article-sentiment-analysis
These two notebooks explore the use of large language models to predict the author sentiment on an entity in news articles. Training and testing data are sampled from the [PerSent](https://stonybrooknlp.github.io/PerSenT/) dataset. In total, three approaches were used: fine tuning the pretrained DistilBERT model to perform this task, zero-shot classification with the Flan-T5 model, and few-shot classification with the Flan-T5 model.
